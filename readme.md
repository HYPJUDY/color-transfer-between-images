**Implementation and improvement** of paper: *Color Transfer between Images, Erik Reinhard et al, 2001* —— A simple statistical analysis to impose one image’s color characteristics on another.

I put forward a method called [PureColorGuidedStyle](#PureColorGuidedStyle) which is a easier, faster more controllable version based on this paper's method. It can obtain better results most of the time.
