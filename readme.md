**Implementation and improvement** of paper: *Color Transfer between Images, Erik Reinhard et al, 2001* —— A simple statistical analysis to impose one image’s color characteristics on another.

I put forward a method called [PureColorGuidedStyle](#PureColorGuidedStyle) which is a easier, faster more controllable version based on this paper's method. It can obtain better results most of the time.

Images are available. Codes implemented with [The CImg Library](http://cimg.eu/) in C++ language. For more detail about the Intuition, Algorithm, Implementation, Results and My Improvement of Color Transfer, please read [my post](https://hypjudy.github.io/2017/03/19/paperreading-color-transfer/).
